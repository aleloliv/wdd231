**Meyzam Engineering Website**

The Meyzam Engineering website is designed with a clean and straightforward layout, tailored for a company specializing in electrical plans and projects. The homepage introduces the company and showcases images of their completed projects. A prominent 'Contact Us' button leads visitors to a form where they can enter their name, phone number, email, address, and specific requirements. 

The second page serves as both a portfolio and an 'About Us' section. It highlights the company's major projects, vision, mission, and values, accompanied by relevant images. The third page features the 'Contact Us' form as described earlier.

Meyzam is my entrepreneurial venture, aiming to establish a successful business in Electrical Engineering. Despite my passion and skills, marketing has been a significant challenge, and I believe a well-designed website will be a powerful tool to promote my company effectively.
